# A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located on 
# one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get to the opposite bank (position X+1). 
# Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.

# You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. 
# A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.

# The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river. 
# The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X 
# (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves). 
# You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, 
# i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.

# For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:

#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 3
#   A[2] = 1
#   A[3] = 4
#   A[4] = 2
#   A[5] = 3
#   A[6] = 5
#   A[7] = 4
# In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.

# Write a function:

# def solution(X, A)

# that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.

# If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return âˆ’1.
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X].
